This project aims to build a highly accurate machine learning model to predict housing prices using advanced Gradient Boosting algorithms. The dataset contains property features such as number of rooms, lot size, construction quality, neighborhood information, and other house characteristics.
The goal is to develop a model that can understand complex relationships between features and accurately estimate housing prices.
🎯 Project Objectives

Perform thorough Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA).

Handle missing values, outliers, and data inconsistencies.

Apply feature engineering & encoding for categorical features.

Train and compare XGBoost and LightGBM models.

Evaluate models using RMSE, MAE, R² score.

Identify the most important features that affect house prices.
🤖 Modeling Approach
✔ 1. XGBoost Regressor

Handles missing values internally

Uses advanced boosting

Great for tabular data

Hyperparameters tuned (learning rate, max_depth, subsample, n_estimators)

✔ 2. LightGBM Regressor

Faster & more memory-efficient than XGBoost

Handles large datasets

Leaf-wise tree growth for better accuracy

Tuned hyperparameters for best performance
